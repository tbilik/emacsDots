	Work around subrs that block EXWM; other minor fixes

	Some subrs (e.g. x-file-dialog) create X windows and block the

2015-08-28  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Drop intro to xelb-util

2015-08-27  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Avoid deleting the frame created by Emacs client by accident

	When Emacs is invoked as `emacsclient -a '' -c`, it creates a frame
	that can be deleted without any prompt. This commit removes the
	`client` parameter from that frame to avoid such inconvenience.

2015-08-27  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Re-enable complete refresh of keyboard mapping

	Since the performance of `xcb:keysyms:update-keyboard-mapping` is no

	again.

2015-08-27  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

2015-08-26  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Replay KeyPress events instead of fake them in line-mode

	X windows in line-mode receive KeyPress events faked with SendEvent
	requests previously. This causes many problems including:

	* Some applications (e.g. xterm) ignore synthetic events completely
	* KeyPress and KeyRelease evnets arrive disorderly

	This commit makes EXWM exploiting AllowEvents requests (in
	ReplayKeyboard mode) to forward KeyPress events to X windows instead.

2015-08-25  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Merge pull request #42 from pipcet/ewmh-fullscreen

	https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/pull/42

2015-08-24  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Only manage windows mapped as the direct children of root window (close
	#38)

	Sometimes Emacs create child windows of virtual roots. This commit
	ensures EXWM will not manage them.

2015-08-17  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Merge branch 'move-window-fix' of https://github.com/pipcet/exwm into

	#28)

2015-08-14  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Honor `value-mask` field in ConfigureRequest event

	Some applications (e.g. JNLP) don't set correct values for fields not
	mentioned in `value-mask`. This commit corrects this bug together with
	another Java AWT specific problem.

2015-08-13  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix input focus stealing

	This was fixed in b755296 but broken by 04e4269.

2015-08-13  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix multi-screen bugs

	* RandR module is now made optional; users can enable it with
	 `exwm-randr-enable`.
	* Correct the calculation of sizes/coordinates at various places.
	* Input focus is now tracked with (Emacs) window instead of buffer
	since the
	 latter can be ambiguous in multi-screen settings.

2015-08-13  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Minor fixes for emacsclient

2015-08-12  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Improve input focus switch mechanism

	This commit should fix most input focus bugs (especially those related
	to floating windows). The actual settings of input focus are delayed to
	exclude redundant event. Dead code since this commit is removed.

	This commit also fixes a bug for non-floating windows converted form
	floating state. The workaround for `ido-mode` is also improved to
	properly handle
	`exwm-mode` buffers.

2015-08-11  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Center floating windows by default

	This commit makes a floating window centered to its leading window if

	center of the screen.

2015-08-11  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix buffer switch problems

	* Prevent switching to floating windows or windows on other workspaces

	Remove redundant code caused by the concurrency of events (contd, 2)

	* Remove locks that are no longer required
	* Also fix #20 (inactive workspace frame steals input focus)

2015-08-10  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Ignore repeated `MappingNotify` events

	For some reason, `MappingNotify` events are generated quite frequently
	and greatly impact the performance. This commit disables the complete
	refresh of keyboard mapping.

2015-08-10  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Remove redundant code caused by the concurrency of events (continued)

	Remove `exwm--with-current-id`, which was introduced to as a wrapper to
	`with-current-buffer` to do extra checks. Note that in functions run as
	hooks, the validation of window ID is still required as they are not
	synchronized with events.

2015-08-10  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix emacsclient bugs

	`emacsclient` started with `-c` or `-t` argument create a new frame
	that shall not be used to manage X windows. Also fix some related input
	focus issues (with some remaining unfixed). Close #17.

	Remove redundant code caused by the concurrency of events

	With the introduction of ch11ng/xelb@6a7bccc, many weird behaviors
	should disappear. These include by not limit to
	* race conditions when managing a window (a workaround is provided in
	@14628a9)
	* race conditions when unmanaging a window This commit removes some
	corresponding code.

2015-08-09  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Refresh when minibuffer grows (fix #10)

	The expansion of echo area is not handled however.

2015-08-08  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Show moved window by default

2015-08-08  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Correct layout refresh problems

	* Relax the conditions to refresh layout; this may introduce some
	overheads
	 though
	* Fix the problem when `*scratch*` buffer is killed; close #12
	* Enhance `exwm-reset` by forcing layout refresh in it. This should
	allow users
	 to overcome some layout bugs

2015-08-08  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix some input focus issues

	* Fix input focus lost after moving window to another workspace
	* Enhance `exwm-reset` to provide user a way to reset input focus when
	it's
	 lost unexpectedly

2015-08-08  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fixes for manage/unmanage window

	* Make sure `exwm-manage--manage-window-queue` is cleaned
	* Improve input focus handling after unmanaging a window
	* Remove a redundant call to `exwm-layout--show`

2015-08-07  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix race conditions when managing a window

	Since it takes some time for EXWM to create a buffer for a window (to
	do some checking for example), the window may send several MapRequest
	events before it's mapped. This commit should fix such issue.

2015-08-07  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix input focus lost after closing window

	Also insert some debug messages.

2015-08-07  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Various input fixes

	* Fix `exwm-reset`
	* Make input mode buffer local
	* Allow window to stay in `char-mode` while setting input focus to
	other window
	 or switching to other workspace

2015-08-06  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Check buffer mode in exwm-reset

	This should prevent users from misoperation.

2015-08-06  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix fullscreen issues

	* Correct ConfigureNotify events sent to fullscreen windows.
	* Exit fullscreen mode before switching workspace.
	* Temporarily treat `xcb:Atom:_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE` as
	 `xcb:Atom:_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN` since
	 a) "plugin-container" (Flash Player) seems only set this, and
	 b) it's not normally used by applications.
	 This makes fullscreen videos working in e.g. iceweasel.

2015-08-05  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Drop intro to EXIM

2015-08-05  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Various fixes

	* Prevent marking the end of a key sequence with a single `C-u'.
	* Enable `C-u' prefix for key simulation since it's not possible for
	users to
	 define simulation keys starting with `C-u'.
	* Make Emacs idle only after the visual parts are updated to prevent
	from
	 disturbing users.
	* Should use '?\s' instead of '? '.

2015-08-05  Markus S.  <kamikazow@web.de>

	Fix typos

2015-08-03  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Add basic RandR support

	This implementation is analogous to that in i3-wm, which requires
	external tools to properly configure RandR first.

2015-07-26  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Fix potential naming conflicts

	Buffers may share a same name (without the possible leading space) when
	created in different workspaces.

2015-07-19  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Various fixes

	Remove wrong shift modifiers. Hide a Window when it's moved to another
	workspace.

2015-07-18  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Various fixes for workspace

	Fixes for full screen, move window, etc.

2015-07-18  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Add wiki link to README

2015-07-18  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	Improve move/resize

	The type of move/resize is consistent during one complete operation. So
	there is no need to judge it on every mouse motion.

2015-07-17  Chris Feng	<chris.w.feng@gmail.com>

	First commit
